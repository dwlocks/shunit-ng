Make it possible to execute a single test by passing the name of the test on
the command line

Add support for '--randomize-order' so that the test order is randomized to
check for dependencies (which shouldn't be there) between tests.

--debug option to display point in source code (line number and such) where the
problem showed up.

Add tests for assertTrue() and others that take at most 2 arguments, and check
that errors are thrown when too many are given.
