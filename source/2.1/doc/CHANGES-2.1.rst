Changes in shUnit2 2.1.X
========================

Changes with 2.1.0 (since 2.0.1)
--------------------------------

This release is a branch of the 2.0.1 release.

Moving to `reStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ for
the documentation.

Fixed problem with ``fail()``. The failure message was not properly printed.

Fixed the ``Makefile`` so that the DocBook XML and XSLT files would be
downloaded before parsing can continue.
